Apply for API key by filling out form
https://forms.gle/5E8hsZhyd94X9a3M7.

API keys are necessary to simplify testing of the 
adapters and even if we will review untested adapters, 
process will be a lot faster if developers tests 
adapters using API key before submitting a pull request.

Each API key has a limit of 5000 requests. If you need
higher limit - [contact us](/contact-us).
